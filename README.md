# Lutris Scripts

Because Lutris can take _forever_ to approve any scripts, and they can be incredibly slow to update. This'll be populated with any scripts I've created or edited myself. Further details or instructions for each script will be in the README within each game folder alongside any credits where applicable.


### Installation
Download the .yml for the game you want to install, use `lutris -i [path to script file]` in the terminal to install. That's it.
Needless to say, but [Lutris](https://github.com/lutris/lutris) is a requirement. It is also a good idea to install _all_ optional Wine packages for the best compatibility. A good guide can be found [here](https://www.gloriouseggroll.tv/how-to-get-out-of-wine-dependency-hell/).


#### Bug Reports
Issues? Open a [bug report](https://github.com/CPU-Blanc/Lutris-Scripts/issues/new) with a clear reference to which script is broken or needs updating. Alternatively, feel free to open a Pull Request.
