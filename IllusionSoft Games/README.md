# IllusionSoft Games


## Koikatsu! & Koikatsu! Sunshine
Download and run `koikatsu.yml` by running `lutris -i /path/to/koikatsu.yml` in your terminal. Both will work with this installer.
**This installer is designed to work with the BetterRepack version**. The games *will* still launch with other versions (HF), though the extra features like launching KKManager and CharaStudio from the same Lutris launcher may not work due to differing file paths.

Note: This script installs .NET 3.5.0 & .NET 4.7.2. The installer **will** hang during these installs. This is normal, and can take upwards of 20 minutes.
